# OntopLayout

This project was the coding challenge by Ontop. The goal of this challenge was to implement a pre-defined layout (made in figma) using Angular. Responsiveness was the main hardship, some componets didn't worked as expected due the fact that i was using third-party libraries like Angular Material, so some pre-defined css was mixed with my code. 

Overall, i belive that the final result is good considering the time constraints. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
