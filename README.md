# OntopLayout

This project was the coding challenge by Ontop. The goal of this challenge was to implement a pre-defined layout (made in figma) using Angular. Responsiveness was the main hardship, some components didn't worked as expected due the fact that i was using third-party libraries like Angular Material, so some pre-defined css was mixed with my code. 

Overall, i belive that the final result is good considering the time constraints. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Missing implementations

Some of the requests are missing due to the time restriction and lack of knowledge of some aspects of CSS.

- "Contract Type" input field is not aligned vertically
- Table rows do not have the correct styling.
- The actions button is not implemented.
- "Filter" and "New Hire" buttons do not have icons, for some reason the adding them was breaking th css.
